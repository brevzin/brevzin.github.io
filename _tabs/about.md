I'm a C++ developer at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com), member of the C++ standards committee, and unreasonably active on StackOverflow in the various C++ tags.

Sampling of accepted standards proposals:

* Prominent features:
  * [Deducing `this`](https://wg21.link/p0847)
* `constexpr`-related
  * [constexpr *INVOKE*](https://wg21.link/p1065)
  * [if consteval](https://wg21.link/p1938)
  * [Missing constexpr in std::optional and std::variant](https://wg21.link/p2231)
  * [Using unknown references in constant expressions](https://wg21.link/p2280) (from my post on the [constexpr array size problem]({% post_url 2020-02-05-constexpr-array-size %}))
  * [Relaxing some constexpr restrictions](https://wg21.link/p2448)
  * [consteval needs to propagate up](https://wg21.link/p2564)
  * [Permitting static constexpr variables in constexpr functions](https://wg21.link/p2647)
  * [constexpr placement new](https://wg21.link/p2747)
* Ranges-related
  * [*forwarding-range*&lt;T> is too subtle](https://wg21.link/p1870)
  * [Concept traits should be named after concepts](https://wg21.link/p1871)
  * [Conditionally borrowed ranges](https://wg21.link/p2017)
  * [Superior String Splitting](https://wg21.link/p2210) (from my post on [implementing a better split]({% post_url 2020-07-06-split-view %}))
  * [cbegin should always return a constant iterator](https://wg21.link/p2278)
  * [Formatting Ranges](https://wg21.link/p2286)
  * [ranges::fold](https://wg21.link/p2322)
  * [Views should not be required to be default constructible](https://wg21.link/p2325)
  * [Pipe support for user-defined range adaptors](https://wg21.link/p2387)
  * [What is a view?](https://wg21.link/p2415)
  * [views::join_with](https://wg21.link/p2441)
  * [views::as_rvalue](https://wg21.link/p2446)
  * [move_iterator&lt;T*> should be a random access iterator](https://wg21.link/p2520)
  * [Improve default container formatting](https://wg21.link/p2585)
  * [Poison Pills are Too Toxic](https://wg21.link/p2602)

I've given a few conference talks:

* CppNow 2021: [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ to D to Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qY4dZ2r4w)
* CPPP 2021: [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ D, Rust, and Others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95uT0RhMGwA) (an extended version)
* CppCon 2022: [The Surprising Complexity of Formatting Ranges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQELdyecZlU)

I'm also a swimming enthusiast and data junkie, writing the occasional post for [SwimSwam](https://www.swimswam.com) and doing some work for the [DC Trident](https://www.instagram.com/dctridentisl/?hl=en) professional swim team.
