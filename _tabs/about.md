I'm a C++ developer at [Jump Trading](https://www.jumptrading.com), member of the C++ standards committee, and unreasonably active on StackOverflow in the various C++ tags. I've given a few conference talks:

* CppNow 2021: [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ to D to Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3qY4dZ2r4w)
* CPPP 2021: [Iterators and Ranges: Comparing C++ D, Rust, and Others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95uT0RhMGwA) (an extended version)
* CppCon 2022: The Surprising Complexity of Formatting Ranges

I'm also a swimming enthusiast and data junkie, writing the occasional post for [SwimSwam](https://www.swimswam.com) and doing some work for the [DC Trident](https://www.instagram.com/dctridentisl/?hl=en) professional swim team.
